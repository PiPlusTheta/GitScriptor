# GitScriptor - Gemini AI Integration Complete! üéâ

## What Was Implemented

I have successfully integrated Google Gemini AI into your GitScriptor project to make it fully functional. Here's what was done:

### üîß Core Functionality Added

1. **Enhanced `agents.py`** with Gemini AI integration:
   - Repository analysis (detects languages, frameworks, file structure)
   - Intelligent README generation using Google Gemini API
   - Fallback mechanisms for error handling
   - Support for multiple programming languages and frameworks

2. **API Key Integration**:
   - Added your Gemini API key: `AIzaSyBe664wCJ3_w7qexXZ4QEEkbIklh5rKRiU`
   - Environment variable support for secure key management
   - Both hardcoded fallback and environment variable options

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

1. **Dependencies Added**:
   - `requests` library for API calls
   - `python-dotenv` for environment variables
   - Created `pyproject.toml` for the core package

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Added CORS middleware to the FastAPI backend
   - Allows frontend (localhost:5173) to communicate with API (localhost:8000)

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created `.env` file with API key
   - Updated Docker Compose to pass environment variables

### üß™ Testing Results

‚úÖ **Gemini API Test**: Successfully generates README content  
‚úÖ **Health Endpoint**: Returns `{"ok": true}`  
‚úÖ **Generate Endpoint**: Creates intelligent README for GitHub repos  
‚úÖ **Frontend**: React app loads and connects to API  
‚úÖ **Full Integration**: Complete end-to-end functionality working  

### üöÄ How to Use

1. **With Docker** (if Docker is available):
   ```bash
   cd "GitScriptor-Web"
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. **Without Docker** (current setup):
   - **API Server**: Already running on http://localhost:8000
   - **Frontend**: Already running on http://localhost:5173
   - **Usage**: Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

### üéØ How It Works

1. **User Input**: Paste a GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi`)
2. **Repository Analysis**: 
   - Clones the repo to temporary directory
   - Analyzes file structure, languages, and frameworks
   - Reads key configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. **AI Generation**: 
   - Sends structured prompt to Gemini AI
   - Includes repository context and analysis
   - Generates comprehensive, professional README
4. **Results**: Returns formatted README with execution time

### üîç Example API Response

The API now generates intelligent content like:

```json
{
  "markdown": "# FastAPI Project\n\nA modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.\n\n## Features\n\n* Fast: Very high performance...",
  "elapsed_ms": 11883
}
```

### üé® Frontend Features

- **Clean UI**: Material-UI components
- **URL Validation**: Validates GitHub repository URLs
- **Loading States**: Shows progress during generation
- **Error Handling**: Displays helpful error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### üîí Security Notes

- API key is included in environment variables
- CORS is configured for development (localhost only)
- Git clone operations are sandboxed in temporary directories

## Ready to Use! üöÄ

Your GitScriptor application is now fully functional with Google Gemini AI integration. You can:

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Paste any public GitHub repository URL
3. Click "Generate README" 
4. Get an intelligent, comprehensive README in seconds!

The system is intelligent enough to detect project types, frameworks, and generate appropriate documentation sections including installation instructions, usage examples, and more.
